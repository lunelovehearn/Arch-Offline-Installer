# Arch-Offline-Installer (WIP)
A completely offline, vanilla Arch Linux installer.
This is a work in progress, being done on my free time.

## Forked from EZArcher by EZnix on SourceForge. All template credits go to him. 

this project exists as a personal project as response to the official Arch ISO lacking an offline way to install Arch. Altought the official method is powerful and great, there are moments when a hi-speed internet connection is out of reach. that's where this project comes to mind. 

with time, I'll try to make a gnome variant of the ISO, something EZarcher haven't done so far.
releases will be added once enough testing is done.
