# Arch-Offline-Installer
A completely offline, vanilla Arch Linux installer.

Forked from EZArcher by EZnix on SourceForge. All template credits go to him. 

this project exists as a personal project as response to the official Arch ISO lacking an offline way to install Arch. Altought the official method is powerful and great, there are moments when a hi-speed internet connection is out of reach. that's where this project comes to mind.
