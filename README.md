# Arch-Offline-Installer (WIP)
A completely offline, vanilla Arch Linux installer.

### Note: This is a work in progress, being done on my free time.

## Forked from EZArcher by EZnix on SourceForge. All template credits go to him.
source: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezarch/

This project exists as a personal project as response to the official Arch ISO lacking an offline way to install Arch. Altought the official method is powerful and great, there are moments when a hi-speed internet connection is out of reach. that's where this project comes to mind. 

releases will be added once enough testing is done.


### Preview:

## TO-DO list:

- remove root password requirement on live session login
- enable autologin
- add calamares installer icon on live session desktop
- set a custom wallpaper for the live session
- make a script that removes calamares icon and itself once the system reboots to the newly installed system
- add nvidia hardware support and boot entry
- create branding and clean up code
- create spins for WMs (help wanted)
- add custom fonts package
- add encryption support/test it
- make the other DE spins, starting with GNOME
- with time, I'll try to make a gnome variant of the ISO, something EZarcher haven't done so far.
- you tell me :)


# Help wanted
- to configure WMs/write documentation
- beta testers with real hardware, mostly nvidia users
- need help adding an nvidia boot option to grub ISO
- help adding more features to calamares
- help with cleaning the code
