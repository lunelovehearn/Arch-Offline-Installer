# Arch-Offline-Installer (WIP)
A completely offline, vanilla Arch Linux installer.
This is a work in progress, being done on my free time.

## Forked from EZArcher by EZnix on SourceForge. All template credits go to him.
source: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezarch/

this project exists as a personal project as response to the official Arch ISO lacking an offline way to install Arch. Altought the official method is powerful and great, there are moments when a hi-speed internet connection is out of reach. that's where this project comes to mind. 

with time, I'll try to make a gnome variant of the ISO, something EZarcher haven't done so far.
releases will be added once enough testing is done.


### Preview:

## TO-DO list:

- remove root password requirement on live session login
- enable autologin

- set a custom wallpaper for the live session
- make a script that removes calamares icon and itself once the system reboots to the newly installed system
- add nvidia hardware support and boot entry
- create branding and clean up code
- create spins for WMs (help wanted)
- add custom fonts package
- make the other DE spins, starting with GNOME
- you tell me :)
